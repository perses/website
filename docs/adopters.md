Adopters Logo
=============

Whether you are contributing to the project or using it, we would love to hear from you.

Requirements for the company:

* It is contributing to the project, or it is using Perses
* it is a legal registered company
* it is happy to announce that it is using Perses publicly


If these requirements are met, in the repository [perses/website](https://github.com/perses/website), add yourself
   the logo in the folder `assets/images/logos/`.

* If your company has a dark and light theme, add both.
* The logo should be in SVG or PNG format, and the name of the file should be the name of the company in CamelCase,
  with no space or special character.
* To differentiate the theme, add in the name of the file `dark_theme` or `light_theme`.

For example, `Mycompany.svg` or `Mycompany_dark_theme.svg` and `Mycompany_light_theme.svg`.

Then add the logo in the file `docs/index.md` in the section "Adopters" with the following format:

```markdown
- [![Mycompany logo](assets/images/logos/Mycompany_dark_theme.svg#only-dark)](https://mycompany.com) [![Mycompany logo](assets/images/logos/Mycompany_light_theme.svg#only-light)](https://mycompany.com)
```
