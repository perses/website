# Release v0.52.0

## New profiling plugins

This release provides the support of Continuous Profiling through two plugins:

- **Pyroscope**: a datasource plugin for retrieving and handling data from a Pyroscope server.
- **Flame Chart**: a visualization plugin which contains 3 panels: Flame Graph, Table View and Series Chart.

### What is Continuous Profiling?

Continuous Profiling is a new observability signal, complementing the traditional logs, metrics, and traces. This innovative approach provides a way of continuously measuring applications' resource consumption with code-level granularity and low overhead. This signal generates excitement in the community for its ability to provide in-depth visibility into production performance of applications.

### Panels

#### Flame Graph

The flame graph panel offers a simple and intuitive way to represent performance data, providing a hierarchical view that let you zoom in on any stack for a detailed analysis. It helps to understand resource allocations (CPU, Memory, ...) and bottlenecks within an application.

#### Table View

This panel displays the profile in a table format. It allows you to sort stacks, for example in descending order, to see which function consume the most resources. A search bar is also present for filtering the table and highlighting stacks in the flame graph.

#### Series Chart

When retrieving profiles from the Pyroscope server, they include timeline data showing how the total amount of resources consumed evolves over time, depending on the selected profile type. This panel allows you to visualize this data in order to identify spikes in resource consumption (CPU, memory, etc.) and focus on them by zooming into the corresponding time range.

## Heatmap

As spoiled on the previous release note, the heatmap panel has been added on Perses! 
It is now possible to visualize Prometheus native histograms in a heatmap format. This panel is particularly useful for visualizing latency distributions over time.

This panel still need to be improved, so stay tuned for future updates! Or even better, contribute to it! List of improvements to be done can be found in the [GitHub issue #2978](https://github.com/perses/perses/issues/2978)

## Support new query types

## Support SQL queries in the backend

## User profile

## Discard changes prompt

When editing a dashboard, if you try to leave the page with unsaved changes, a prompt will appear to warn you about potential lost changes.
There are 2 different prompts depending on how you try to leave the page:
- If you try to navigate to another page in Perses, a modal will appear to confirm you want to leave the page.
- If you try to close the tab or navigate to another website, a browser native prompt will appear.

## Explorer improvements

Explorer can now show more information about your resources, thanks to collapsable tab menu!

Few other improvements have been made to the explorer, such as:
- Tabs are now sorted alphabetically
- The metric finder datasource selector is rendered correctly
- Metric finder filter inputs are now displayed in 3 parts: key, operator, value. Instead of a single input.
-
