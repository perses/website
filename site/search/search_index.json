Additionally, it introduces a new Status History Panel and various enhancements to the Table Panel, UI, and CLI. Read on to learn more about the new features and improvements in this release.</p> <p>See the complete release note for more details: v0.50.0</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/01/15/release-v0500/#migration","title":"Migration","text":"<p>One of the greatest contents of this release is the migration that has been drastically improved.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the project, we have been willing to provide an easy way to migrate dashboards from Grafana to Perses. As a reminder, you can migrate a Grafana dashboard using the HTTP endpoint <code>/api/migrate</code> or the UI or the CLI that consumes this endpoint.</p> <p>The big issue with this feature was the memory leak that was hidden and not that easy to trigger. (See issue #2039)</p> <p>This was a big blocker for the migration and one of the main reasons why Amadeus was not able to migrate to Perses. Amadeus has a huge number of dashboards, and the memory leak was too important to be ignored. To give you an idea, the memory leak was about 40GB after migrating 3000 dashboards. (~ 3MB per dashboard)</p> <p></p> <p>As you may know, we are using Cuelang for the Perses plugin validation, and at first, we implemented a complete way to migrate using Cuelang only. The idea behind was to append every migration script (one for each panel, variable, queries) to the main one. Then the Grafana JSON was converted to a Cuelang value, and we were applying the migration script to this value.</p> <p>With the v0.50.0, we are changing deeply and only internally the way it's working. It doesn't change anything for the user, but it's a huge improvement for the maintainability and the performance of the migration.</p> <p>We have entirely rewritten the migration process. It is now using a hybrid system partially written in Golang and the rest in Cuelang when the plugins are involved. Thanks to this new system, the Cuelang files written to migrate the panels, the variables, and the queries can be validated and tested before the migration is applied.</p> <p>Thanks to this change, we are happy to announce the memory leak has been fixed and the migration is now working perfectly. We performed the same mass migration, and it succeeded without causing OOMKill, as it requires much less memory than before. The graph below shows we didn't exceed 3GB of memory during the migration.</p> <p></p> <p>Finally, we\u2019ve also addressed numerous updates to the migration process itself, incorporating fixes and enhancements to better cover use cases raised by the community - thank you for your contributions!</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/01/15/release-v0500/#status-history-panel","title":"Status History panel","text":"<p>Thanks to Alexander Belyakin from the community, Perses is supporting a new Panel: the Status History Panel.</p> <p>The Status History panel provides a visual representation of the status of various metrics over time.

This panel is particularly useful for monitoring the health and performance of systems, as it can display status changes in a clear and concise manner. The panel can be customized to show different statuses, such as up, down, warning, or any other user-defined states, and it supports various visualization options to enhance the readability of the data.</p> <p>And of course, this panel is fully compatible with the migration process.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/01/15/release-v0500/#general-improvements","title":"General Improvements","text":""},{"location":"blog/2025/01/15/release-v0500/#ui","title":"UI","text":"<p>We have finally added the redirection to the initial URL after you are authenticated.

However we are working hard to expand coverage!</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"perses/docs/migration/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>As we are always supporting the last version of Grafana, we advise to have your Grafana dashboard up to date if the latest version of Grafana.</p> <p>When we started to develop Perses, the latest version of Grafana was 9.0.0.
